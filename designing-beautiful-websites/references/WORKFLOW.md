# UX/UI Workflow for Websites

> Use this when you need an end-to-end plan, deliverables, or a repeatable way to go from vague intent → shippable design.

## Operating principles
- **Build from intent to pixels**: decisions about colour and layout are constrained by goals, content, and flows.
- **Work iteratively, not sequentially**: higher-level design can reveal missing lower-level decisions. Expect to revisit.
- **Optimise the key paths first**: a site that nails the primary journeys beats a site with 40 mediocre pages.
- **Design for scanning**: on the web, users skim and select; structure and hierarchy are the design.
- **System > screens**: design tokens + components prevent “one-off UI” and accelerate implementation.

## Phase 0: Define the problem
Output: **one-page design brief**.

Checklist:
- Who is the product/site for?
- What is the #1 outcome the user must achieve?
- What is the #1 business outcome?
- What constraints exist (tech, brand, legal, accessibility, time)?
- What is the current baseline (what works, what fails)?

Rules:
- If details are missing, write assumptions explicitly.
- Tie design decisions to outcomes (conversion, retention, comprehension, task completion).

## Phase 1: Users and goals
Pick a lightweight method based on time.

### Option A: Persona-lite (fast)
Create 1–2 persona-lites that capture:
- goals (why they’re here),
- context (device, environment, time pressure),
- anxieties/risks (what makes them hesitate),
- capabilities (experience level, accessibility needs).

### Option B: Job story (fastest)
Format:
- **When** [situation]
- **I want** [motivation]
- **So I can** [expected outcome]

### Option C: Full persona + scenario (when high stakes)
Write a short narrative of an ideal experience that emphasises goals and context.

Rules:
- **Goals before tasks**: tasks are symptoms; goals drive prioritisation.
- Prefer a small “cast” with clear priority:
  - primary persona (design target),
  - secondary personas (supported, but not driving the UI).

## Phase 2: Scope and requirements
Output: **scope list + key paths**.

Steps:
1. List pages/screens and major features.
2. Do a content inventory (what copy, images, data exist?).
3. Define 1–3 **key paths**.

Key path examples:
- Landing → pricing → signup
- Search → filter → item detail → checkout
- Dashboard → create report → export/share

Rules:
- If everything is a priority, nothing is. Pick the journeys that matter.
- Delay “nice to have” features until the key paths are frictionless.

## Phase 3: Information architecture and navigation
Output: **IA diagram + navigation model + labels**.

Checklist:
- Global nav: top-level sections (5–7 is usually enough).
- Local nav: within a section, how do users move laterally?
- Search: if discovery matters, define where search lives and how results work.
- Page naming: every page needs a clear name that matches the user’s mental model.

Rules:
- Labels must be obvious. Avoid internal jargon and clever marketing names.
- Prefer recognition over recall: show choices; don’t force memory.
- Keep navigation consistent across pages.

## Phase 4: Interaction model
Output: **flows + interaction rules + state model**.

Steps:
1. For each key path, write the step-by-step flow.
2. Define interaction patterns:
   - forms,
   - filtering/sorting,
   - selection,
   - editing,
   - confirmations/destructive actions.
3. Define states for each key screen:
   - loading,
   - empty,
   - error,
   - success,
   - partial data,
   - permissions.

Rules:
- Prefer preventing errors (smart defaults, constraints) over showing errors.
- Prefer modeless feedback (inline status, previews) over disruptive dialogs.

## Phase 5: Skeleton (wireframes and layout)
Output: **wireframes + component inventory**.

Steps:
1. Start with a real feature/content block (not a nav bar).
2. Place information in priority order.
3. Establish page regions:
   - site ID,
   - navigation,
   - primary content,
   - secondary content,
   - calls to action.
4. Define responsive layout constraints:
   - max content width,
   - breakpoints,
   - column strategy.

Rules:
- A page should be parsable at a glance into clearly defined areas.
- Make click targets and interactive affordances obvious.

## Phase 6: Surface (visual system and comps)
Output: **tokens + component library + page comps**.

Steps:
1. Create tokens:
   - spacing/sizing,
   - type scale,
   - colours (with shades),
   - radius,
   - elevation.
2. Define components and variants.
3. Apply to key pages first.

Rules:
- Constrain choices. Systems beat arbitrary numbers.
- Use spacing to clarify grouping.
- Use colour sparingly for meaning (actions and status), not decoration.

## Phase 7: Validate and iterate
Output: **issues + fixes + updated design**.

Use quick, repeatable tests:
- **Glance test**: in 10 seconds, can someone tell what it is and what to do?
- **Key-path walkthrough**: can a first-time user complete the journey?
- **Edge case sweep**: long text, missing data, errors, empty.
- **Accessibility sweep**: contrast, focus, keyboard, semantics.

Iteration rule:
- Make the smallest set of changes that remove the largest confusion.

## Phase 8: Handoff
Output: **build-ready package**.

Include:
- tokens (CSS variables or JSON),
- component specs (including states),
- responsive rules,
- accessibility notes,
- content rules (copy lengths, truncation),
- and acceptance criteria for key paths.
