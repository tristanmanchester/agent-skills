# Information Architecture for Websites

> Use this when you need to structure pages, navigation, labels, and findability.

## Table of contents
- [Core concepts](#core-concepts)
- [Sitemaps and navigation models](#sitemaps-and-navigation-models)
- [Labelling and naming](#labelling-and-naming)
- [Search](#search)
- [Page purpose statements](#page-purpose-statements)
- [IA deliverables](#ia-deliverables)

## Core concepts
- **Findability beats novelty**: users rarely explore; they look for a path to the goal.
- **Clear categories reduce thinking**: if top-level sections are obvious, the rest becomes easy.
- **Structure and skeleton are connected**: IA decisions affect layouts, and layouts expose IA problems.

## Sitemaps and navigation models
Choose a model:
- **Marketing site**: Home, Product, Pricing, Docs/Resources, About, Contact.
- **Content site**: Sections by topic, strong search, archive views.
- **Web app**: Tasks and objects drive navigation (not departments or internal team names).

Rules:
- Keep top-level navigation stable and short.
- Use local navigation for depth (subsections) rather than exploding global nav.
- Always make it clear where the user is (active states, breadcrumbs when useful).

## Labelling and naming
Rules:
- Use plain language and familiar terms.
- Prefer user vocabulary over internal vocabulary.
- Avoid clever names that require explanation.
- Keep labels consistent across the site.

Tests:
- Can someone guess what they will see after clicking the link?
- Does the label match the page title?

## Search
Add search if:
- users might not know what the site calls something,
- content is large or frequently updated,
- or there are many objects (products, docs, posts, people).

Rules:
- Put search where users expect it.
- Support partial matches and forgiving input.
- Results should be scannable: highlight matches, show context snippets.

## Page purpose statements
For every key page, write one sentence:
- “This page lets the user ____ so they can ____.”

If you can’t write it, the page is probably trying to do too much.

## IA deliverables
- **Sitemap**: pages and hierarchy.
- **Navigation model**: global + local nav rules.
- **Label glossary**: canonical terms (and forbidden synonyms).
- **Key-path entry points**: where journeys start.
- **Search behaviour**: placement, results design, empty results.
