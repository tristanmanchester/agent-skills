# Common Website Page Patterns

> Use this when you need concrete, reliable page structures (landing pages, pricing, dashboards, settings).

## Table of contents
- [Landing page](#landing-page)
- [Pricing page](#pricing-page)
- [Documentation / resources](#documentation--resources)
- [Signup / onboarding](#signup--onboarding)
- [Dashboard](#dashboard)
- [Settings page](#settings-page)
- [Search results](#search-results)

## Landing page
Goal: communicate value quickly and move users to the next step.

Recommended structure:
1. **Header**: logo, top nav (few items), primary CTA.
2. **Hero**: clear headline, supporting subhead, primary CTA, optional secondary CTA.
3. **Trust**: logos, metrics, short testimonial.
4. **Benefits**: 3–6 benefit cards (outcomes, not features).
5. **How it works**: 3-step explanation or short flow.
6. **Use cases** (optional): choose 2–4, not a long list.
7. **Social proof**: testimonials/case studies.
8. **FAQ**: reduce last-minute hesitation.
9. **Footer**: secondary nav, legal, contact.

Hierarchy rules:
- headline must be understandable without context;
- primary CTA should repeat (but don’t spam it);
- use scannable chunks; avoid long paragraphs.

Common mistakes:
- vague headline that could fit any product;
- multiple competing CTAs with equal weight;
- decorative hero imagery that doesn’t support meaning.

## Pricing page
Goal: help users choose confidently.

Recommended structure:
- short intro: who each plan is for.
- plan cards: 2–4 plans max.
- highlight recommended plan only if it truly is.
- feature comparison: high-signal features, grouped.
- FAQ: billing, cancellation, support.

Rules:
- make the recommended option the easiest choice, not a trick.
- clarify billing period and what happens on renewal.
- avoid footnotes that hide critical limitations.

## Documentation / resources
Goal: help users find answers quickly.

Recommended structure:
- search (prominent).
- categories with clear labels.
- “Getting started” path.
- popular tasks (top queries).

Rules:
- content titles must describe the question they answer.
- show last updated dates if freshness matters.

## Signup / onboarding
Goal: reduce friction and uncertainty.

Recommended structure:
- keep fields minimal.
- explain why you’re asking for each non-obvious field.
- show progress if multi-step.

Rules:
- preserve inputs on error.
- show password requirements up front.
- offer SSO/social login only if it’s reliable.

## Dashboard
Goal: help users act, not admire charts.

Recommended structure:
- page title + primary action.
- key metrics summary (3–6 max).
- recent activity / next steps.
- deeper sections below (charts, tables).

Rules:
- define an information hierarchy; don’t present everything equally.
- density is okay, but spacing must still communicate grouping.
- tables need sorting/filtering conventions and empty states.

## Settings page
Goal: safe changes with clear consequences.

Recommended structure:
- group settings by theme.
- keep destructive actions separated and clearly labelled.
- show current values.

Rules:
- avoid auto-saving unless feedback is explicit.
- confirmations only when irreversible.

## Search results
Goal: help users compare and choose quickly.

Recommended structure:
- search box persists with query.
- result count + filters.
- scannable results: title, key metadata, snippet.
- empty results guidance: suggestions, broaden filters.

Rules:
- keep filters understandable; avoid internal categories.
- show what filters are active.
