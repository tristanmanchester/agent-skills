## Principles
- Words are part of the interface; treat them as design.
- Prefer **plain, obvious language** over cleverness.
- Reduce cognitive load: fewer words, clearer words, placed near the decision.

## Write for scanning
Use:
- short paragraphs,
- bullets,
- meaningful headings,
- emphasis sparingly.

Checklist:
- the first sentence in a section should communicate the point;
- headings should describe the content beneath them;
- avoid walls of text; split into sections.

## Naming and labels
Rules:
- use user vocabulary, not internal jargon;
- keep terms consistent across navigation, headings, and buttons;
- avoid marketing names that hide meaning.

Bad → better examples:
- “Solutions” → “Pricing” / “Use cases” / “Services” (be specific)
- “Learn” → “Docs” / “Guides” / “Resources”
- “Continue” → “Create account” / “Choose plan” / “Pay now”

## Buttons and calls to action
Rules:
- button text should describe the result (“Generate report”).
- primary CTA is singular; secondary CTAs are visually quieter.
- destructive actions must be clearly labelled (“Delete project”).

## Helper text and instructions
Rules:
- put instructions where the decision happens (near the control).
- keep helper text short; link to details if needed.
- don’t rely on placeholder text as the only label.

## Empty states
A good empty state includes:
- what this area is for,
- why it matters,
- an example (if helpful),
- and a clear next step.

## Errors and recovery
Error message template:
- What happened
- Why it matters (optional)
- What to do next

Rules:
- avoid blame (“You did it wrong”).
- be specific (“Password must be at least 12 characters”).
- preserve user input whenever possible.
- for global errors, point to the field or action that caused it.
